  A second update to the next national meet and the effect of the pandemic on event plans
---
Hello all,

This post will detail how the current coronavirus situation affects the national meets. Currently, we have the Dallas national meet scheduled for Labor Day weekend of 2021. At this point, the coronavirus vaccine is starting to roll out, and we expect by the summertime that at least 60-70% of Americans will have received both doses of the vaccine. 

However, different areas have different vaccine percentages, with states in the South generally in the lower side, and states in the North on the higher side. With that said, we anticipate that anyone coming to the convention will be fully vaccinated.

However, to be extra careful, we have postponed the event to **MLK Weekend of 2022. We do not anticipate this date to change further.** Thank you for your understanding. Please follow our website for event plans once we get closer to the event date.

Thank you!
