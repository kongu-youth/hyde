  An update on how the COVID-19 outbreak is affecting our national meets.

Hello everyone,

As you probably are all aware, there is a pandemic that is wreaking havoc across the world. This has led to many measures such as mandatory masks, social distancing, no gatherings of large people.

In light of this situation, we have decided to **postpone** the national meet scheduled for January 2021 to **Labor Day weekend of 2021**. 

Keep in mind that this is a tentative date and is subject to change.

Please monitor our website for updates in case this date changes further.
